Requirements

    Docker
    Kubernetes cluster (local or managed)
    Helm (if using a Helm chart for MongoDB)

Setup
1. Docker Images

Build Docker images for your application. Create Dockerfiles and use the following commands:

bash

# Build the Docker image for your application
docker build -t your-app-image .

# Build the Docker image for MongoDB
docker build -t mongo-image ./path/to/mongodb

# Optionally, push the images to a container registry

2. Kubernetes Deployment

Apply the Kubernetes manifests to deploy your application:

bash

kubectl apply -f your-app-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f your-app-service.yaml

3. MongoDB Deployment

Deploy MongoDB to the cluster. You can use a Helm chart or any other approach:

bash

Usage

    Ensure that the application takes MongoDB connection details from environment variables.
    Access the application endpoints from your host machine using the LoadBalancer, NodePort, or Ingress service (as configured).
